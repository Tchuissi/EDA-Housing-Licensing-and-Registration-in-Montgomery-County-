# Proposal project 1: Housing Licensing and Registration in Montgomery County


**1. What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?**

I have a Master of science in civil engineering and I would like to become a data scientist in real estate industry. I am interested in every aspect of real estate.



**2. Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?**

As I am a french international student, I would need to learn the specificities of the real estate in the US. As I live in Rockville, it would be interesting for me to analyze dataset about Montgomery County. Also, this project will help me to identify the different "structure type" that may not exist in France.

**3. What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?**

Here are the questions I have in mind I would like to answer:
  - What are the three cities in Montgomery County with with the greatest number of licenses registered (licensed)? My hypothesis are Bethesda, Silver Spring and Rockville.
  - What is the Structure Type with the highest licenses?
  - What is the Ownership type with the highest licenses?
  - What is the average licenses per city in Montgomery County?
  - What is the first zip code for these five cities:Rockville, Bethesda, Gaithersburg, Silver Spring and Potomac?


**4. Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?**

I found the data on the website "Data Montgomery". 

Here is the link (https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Consumer-Housing/Housing-Licensing-and-Registration/et5s-xste)

The dataset has 13 columns and 27.3K rows

**5. What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze? What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis?**

Given the questions I need to answer, my unit of analysis will be city, zip code, structure type, ownership type

**7. What kinds of techniques do you plan to use (for example, summary statistics, scatter plot, bar chart, chi-squared test)?**

I will use the summary statistics in my analysis (mean, the maximum,the minimum)

I will also use bar and pie charts
